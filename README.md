# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-EDA-and-Statistical-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes a credit card transaction dataset to detect fraudulent transactions. The dataset includes 284,807 transactions over two days, with 492 flagged as fraud. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and statistical testing to gain insights into fraud patterns.

## Key Steps:
Data Exploration: Initial dataset overview, missing value checks, and data types verification.
Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing data distribution.
Fraud Analysis: Identifying fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions using visualizations.
Feature Engineering & Correlation: Creating new features and analyzing variable relationships.
Statistical Testing: Hypothesis testing (T-test, ANOVA) on transaction patterns.
## Visualizations:
Fraud distribution pie charts, histograms for numerical features, and correlation heatmaps.
## Findings:
Highly imbalanced dataset (0.2% fraud).
Skewed features like Amount and V28.
Hypothesis testing revealed no significant difference between fraud and non-fraud transaction amounts.
## Requirements:
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy
